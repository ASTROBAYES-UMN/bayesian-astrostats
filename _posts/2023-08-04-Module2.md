# Nuclear X-ray sources in galaxies


*Question* What is the probability of a nuclear x-ray source in a galaxy?

The data here are presented and analyzed by Gallo et al. (2010) and consist of x-ray activity detected in 32 out of 100 early-type [Virgo]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster> galaxies.


# Statistical Model, Part 1

1.  $\theta$, probability of X-ray source

2.  $\Theta = [0,1]$

3.  $x = 32$ out of $n=100$

4.  $\mathcal{X}$, all possible possible sequences of 0's and 1's of length 100

5.  $p(x \mid \theta)$, a description of how the data arise

6.  $\nu(\theta)$, assumptions about the unknown state of nature


# Discrete distributions

A *discrete* random variable is one that takes values from a set which is at most countable.

The probability function for a discrete random variable is called a *probability mass function* (pmf). A pmf is a function $p : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that

$p(x) = P(X=x) $

so that $p(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and

$\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1.$

For a discrete random variable, if $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then

$P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} p(x) .$


## Bernoulli distribution

If $X \in \{0,1\}$ and $\theta \in (0,1)$ denotes the probability of $X=1$, then

$P(X=1) = \theta$$ and $$P(X=0) = 1- P(X=1) = 1-\theta.$

We can write this more concisely as

$P(X=x) = \theta^x (1-\theta)^{1-x} \quad x \in \{0,1\},$

which is the pmf corresponding to the *Bernoulli distribution*. This is a useful distribution for binary random variables. We write $X|\theta \sim \text{Bernoulli} (\theta)$ or just $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$.
