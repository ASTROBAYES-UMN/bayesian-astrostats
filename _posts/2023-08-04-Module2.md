# Nuclear X-ray sources in galaxies


*Question* What is the probability of a nuclear x-ray source in a galaxy?

The data here are presented and analyzed by Gallo et al. (2010) and consist of x-ray activity detected in 32 out of 100 early-type [Virgo]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster> galaxies.


# Statistical Model, Part 1

1.  $\theta$, probability of X-ray source

2.  $\Theta = [0,1]$

3.  $x = 32$ out of $n=100$

4.  $\mathcal{X}$, all possible possible sequences of 0's and 1's of length 100

5.  $p(x \mid \theta)$, a description of how the data arise

6.  $\nu(\theta)$, assumptions about the unknown state of nature
