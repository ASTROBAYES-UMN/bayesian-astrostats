# Nuclear X-ray sources in galaxies


*Question* What is the probability of a nuclear x-ray source in a galaxy?

The data here are presented and analyzed by Gallo et al. (2010) and consist of x-ray activity detected in 32 out of 100 early-type [Virgo]<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Cluster> galaxies.


# Statistical Model, Part 1

1.  $\theta$, probability of X-ray source

2.  $\Theta = [0,1]$

3.  $x = 32$ out of $n=100$

4.  $\mathcal{X}$, all possible possible sequences of 0's and 1's of length 100

5.  $p(x \mid \theta)$, a description of how the data arise

6.  $\nu(\theta)$, assumptions about the unknown state of nature


# Discrete distributions

A *discrete* random variable is one that takes values from a set which is at most countable.

The probability function for a discrete random variable is called a *probability mass function* (pmf). A pmf is a function $p : \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that

$p(x) = P(X=x) $

so that $p(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and

$\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) = 1.$

For a discrete random variable, if $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then

$P(X \in A) = \sum_{x \in A} p(x) .$


## Bernoulli distribution

If $X \in \{0,1\}$ and $\theta \in (0,1)$ denotes the probability of $X=1$, then

$P(X=1) = \theta$

and

$P(X=0) = 1- P(X=1) = 1-\theta.$

We can write this more concisely as

$P(X=x) = \theta^x (1-\theta)^{1-x} \quad x \in \left\{ 0,1 \right\} ,$

which is the pmf corresponding to the *Bernoulli distribution*.

This is a useful distribution for binary random variables.
We write $X|\theta \sim \text{Bernoulli} (\theta)$ or just
$X \sim \text{Bernoulli}  (\theta)$.


## Binomial distribution

Recall our data example where 32 X-ray sources were observed out of a total of 100 galaxies. Let's make the additional assumptions that the presence of an X-ray source in a galaxy is independent of other galaxies and that the probability of a galaxy containing an X-ray source is constant across galaxies. This is an example of a *Binomial experiment*.

::: {#def-binomial}
Suppose, for $i=1,\ldots,n$, that $Y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$ independently. If $$ X= \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i,$$ then $$P(X=x \mid \theta) = p(x \mid \theta) = {n \choose x}  \theta^x (1-\theta)^{n-x}.$$ Say that $X$ is a *Binomial* random variable and we write $X|\theta, n \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)$ or just $X\sim \text{Binomial}(n, \theta)$.

::: callout-note
Recall that $$ {n \choose x} = \frac{n!}{x! (n-x)!}$$ is the number of ways to choose, without replacement, $x$ items from $n$ total items.

::: {#exm-binom_calc}
Suppose $X \sim \text{Binomial}(10, .3)$. When $n$ is small Binomial probabilities can be computed directly, but it is easy to use R.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# P(X=3)
dbinom(3, 10, .3)

# P(X \le 2)
dbinom(0, 10, .3) +  dbinom(1, 10, .3) + dbinom(2, 10, .3)

#P(X \le 2)

pbinom(2, 10, .3)
```
